# cs-3310-inversions

Program that counts the inversions (pairs of out-of-order elements) of an array of integers. Made for UVU CS 3310 Analysis of Algorithms. Designed as a solution to Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms Illuminated problem 3.5.

Includes both O(nÂ²) naive version using nested for loops and O(n\*log(n)) version using mergesort.
